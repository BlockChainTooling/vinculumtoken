# VinculumToken 

Vinculum
- A bar drawn over two or more algebraic terms to indicate that they are to be treated as a single term.
- A bandlike structure, such as a ligament.
- A bond or tie.
- This Token.

# What is VinculumToken?
It is an Algorand Standard Asset which runs on the Algorand blockchain. The Algorand blockchain is properly decentralized and environmentally sustainable.

The ultimate goal with Vinculum is to provide liquidity, utility and stability over the long term. This Repo will be an open source store of tools, documents, and the whitepaper which is in progress.

# Features
- Reserve - This was the manager account but 99% of Vinculum was added to a TinyMan pool to ensure the owner can't perform a fast exit (rug pull).
- Freeze - Vinculum is immutable. It cannot be frozen so this has been removed from the Smart Contract.
- Clawback - Vinculum is immutable. It cannot be clawed back so this has been removed from the Smart Contract.
