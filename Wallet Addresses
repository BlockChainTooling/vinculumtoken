The VINC / ALGO Pool will never be touched by me. This contains 9.5 Million vinculum

The remaining 500,000 vinculum is split as follows:

- Developers - 100,000
LWFWAE5ZXQ7AOJK5WVO336VPKHWPCBFME7XAB3COFDCJDMSWOILS5ZM5J4
These funds will be used to pay developers to add features into the Smart Contract.

- Marketing/Advertising - 100,000
LWFWAE5ZXQ7AOJK5WVO336VPKHWPCBFME7XAB3COFDCJDMSWOILS5ZM5J4
These funds will be used to advertise and market vinculum.

- Community Building - 100,000
LWFWAE5ZXQ7AOJK5WVO336VPKHWPCBFME7XAB3COFDCJDMSWOILS5ZM5J4
These funds will be used to help grow and develop a vinculum community. 

- Misc (Games, NFT Platform, Governance Token Etc) - 100,000
LWFWAE5ZXQ7AOJK5WVO336VPKHWPCBFME7XAB3COFDCJDMSWOILS5ZM5J4
These funds will be used to create games and possibly an NFT platform. These ideas are subject to change so this wallet is tagged as misc. 
The dream would be to have a governance voting system so the community can decide on the future. 

- Security Audits - 100,000
LWFWAE5ZXQ7AOJK5WVO336VPKHWPCBFME7XAB3COFDCJDMSWOILS5ZM5J4
Whilst the Algorand blockchain is super secure over time the vinculum token smart contract will develop. These funds will be used to perform external security audits.

I have no vinculum stored in personal accounts.
